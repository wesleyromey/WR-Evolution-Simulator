How to run this software (incl. SDL2) using make:

0. If any of the following steps don't work for you,
    then either
    (a) You're doing it wrong, or
    (b) You're using different software, computer, etc. than me.
        If this is the case, you may have to do these steps differently.

1. Install make.
    If using Windows, try:
    (a) Run command terminal in admin mode
    (b) Type the following commands into the command terminal:
        @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
        choco install make
    
    If the above does NOT work OR you are NOT using Windows,
    try following the instructions contained in the following link:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows

2. If running this on a separate program, then copy and paste everything in this folder
    (except for main.exe, which will automatically be replaced)

3. Create main.exe.
    (a) If using Visual Studio Code,
        type "make" into the command terminal.
        This may be worth a try if using other software

4. Run main.exe
    One way to do this is to type "./main.exe"
    into the command terminal.
