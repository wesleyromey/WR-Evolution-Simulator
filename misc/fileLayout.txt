This file is meant to explain the layout and purpose of each file and folder.
    NOTE: A lot of my folders are meant to separate the header files
    into a hierarchy to prevent errors

If a file or folder isn't explained, it's probably because the file is short
    or the explanation is trivial.

SDL2 and SDL2 image are required for the graphics to work

                        An essential read if you want to use or modify
                        this simulator or any portion of it

    include4.h
    sim.h               Contains functions that run the simulation,
                        deal with object interactions,
                        control the global parameters / cycles, and
                        exit the simulation (while preventing memory leaks)
    debugTests.h        Contains unit tests and debug functions
mainIncludes/
    debug.h             Controls if the simulation is being run in debug mode
    globalVals.h        Defines the global parameters (mostly constants
                        and hash tables)
                        Also contains a function that parses string expressions
    mainIncludes.h      External libraries are defined here
                        Also initializes the global SDL2 parameters
misc/
    documentation.txt   Simplified simulator documentation
    fileLayout.txt      Summarizes the purpose and layout of each file and folder

    howToRun.txt        Summarizes how to compile this program.
                        However, if you just want to run this simulator,

primary/
    custom.h            Contains all the functions that I, Wesley Romey, created
                        that depend on the files in the "mainIncludes/" folder
    eventHandling.h     Event handling (e.g. control user interactions with
                        the simulation such as clicking buttons and pressing keys)
    images.h            Graphics (incl. cells, background, ground, etc.)
                        Also contains functions that help generate the graphics
                        (incl. loading, drawing, and rendering)
    primaryIncludes.h   Link together the header files in "primary/"
                        Contains several functions that are hard to categorize
secondary/
    ai.h                Defines the structure of each node within each cell's AI
    secondaryIncludes.h
src/
    include/SDL2/       Contains the .h files associated with SDL2 and SDL2 image
    lib/...             Contains the library files (.a, .la),
                        CMake source files, and .pc files for SDL2 and SDL2 image
tertiary/
    cells.h             Defines the structure and parameters of each cell
                        (incl. both living and dead). Contains functions for:
                            Managing certain cell interactions
                            Cell abilities (such as cloning, moving, attacking)
                            Cell mutations
                            Enforcing cell constraints (such as xMin <= x <= xMax)
                            Energy, hitpoints, and other individual cell properties
                            Cell decisions
                            Running the cell AI (largely using ai.h)
                            Energy transfer to and from each cell
                            Draw the cell (largely using images.h)

main.cpp                The main file
                        Initializes the simulation
main.exe                If this file exists, then it is an executable file
                        which can be used to run the simulator.
                        Note that this might not run on certain computers,
                        given this program's incompatibility with them.
Makefile                Needed to incorporate SDL2 and SDL2 image into this
                        simulator (incl. src folder and .dll files)
readme.txt              Read this file before running the simulator
SDL2_image.dll          Allows the simulator to include SDL2 image.
SDL2.dll                Allows the simulator to include SDL2.
