The purpose of this file is to summarize the simulator and give
a brief overview about its main components. This is a simplified
documentation of the simulator.


This evolution simulator simulates many single-celled organisms
which gain energy from the sun, ground, predation, or being a scavenger.
Cells typically get energy from a combination of these things, though
specialization is likely.

Sun: The day-night cycle is indicated by the color of the background
(Black - Red - Yellow - White - Cyan, where black indicates night
and Cyan indicates and excessive amount of sunlight). This cycle is
customizeable in terms of aspects like:
    a) Cycle length
    b) Intensity
    c) Day length vs Night length
    d) During the day, the sun's trajectory can resemble a sine wave,
        instantly appear at its max height for the entire day, or perhaps
        remain close to the horizon for most of the day before briefly
        approaching its max height. Anything between these options is also
        possible.

Ground: The ground stores energy, indicated by a gauge. The ground
typically replenishes its energy reserves slowly, though it can be
configured to replenish at any rate. Each cell in the ground
has its own energy amount.

Predation / Scavengry: All cells have the ability to attack. They also have
a certain amount of health (huge bonuses to larger cells). When a cell's
health or energy reach 0, the cell dies, allowing the other cells to
eat their dead bodies. The energy that the cell had when it was alive
can be consumed by other cells, though cells who specialize in eating
dead cells gain a lot more of the energy than cells who do not.
Until a dead cell is eaten, its energy decays into its surroundings
(esp. the ground).

Overcrowding: When other cells are in the same immediate area, they must
compete for energy from the sun, ground, and dead cells. The type of energy
they specialize in determines how well they do when competing.
Generally, larger cells gain a size advantage over and above smaller
cells due to their ability to block smaller cells from receiving energy.
Also, cells must spend energy to deal with their immediate neighbors.
Larger cells don't have to deal with overcrowding as severely because
they take up more area, meaning they have to expend less energy on,
overcrowding and they can gain a larger portion of the sunlight from
their immediate neighbors. However, they tend to have more neighbors
than their smaller counterparts. 

Cell stats: Each cell has many stats or properties, each costing them
a certain amount of energy. These include:
    a) Size (diameter): Larger cells take up more area, so they have more
        health and get bonuses to various stats, but have weaknesses
        such as being attacked by more cells.
    b) Energy Accumulation Method (EAM): This is essentially a scale
        between 0 % and 100 % describing how efficient is is a getting energy
        from 1. Sunlight, 2. Ground, 3. Predation / Scavengery.
        This generates one scale for each of these methods.
        The sum of EAM across all the energy accumulation methods must be
        exactly equal to 100 %.
    c) Speed: A cell can stand still, walk at some walking speed, or run
        at a faster running speed. However, travelling fast expends
        increasingly insane amounts of energy. The amount of energy consumed
        is more linear at small scales, but becomes cubic
        at larger scales as of 2023-05-24.
    d) Vision: This is the distance at which a cell can detect nearby
        cells.
    e) Mutation rate: Whenever a cell clones itself, some of its properties
        may mutate based on this mutation rate.
    f) Attack: The amount of damage a cell does to other cells when it
        attacks them. Larger cells can have more attack for less energy.
        When a cell attacks, all of its immediate neighbors
        receive the same amount of damage as of 2023-05-24.
    g) Health: A cell must expend energy keeping up its max health.
        Larger cells spend less energy to keep up their health.
        Cells with lower max health spend less energy, but die more easily.
    h) Age: Each cell gets older each frame. Young cells barely have to worry
        about this, but the amount of energy a cell must spend increases
        drastically as the cell ages, incentivizing it to self-destruct
        or otherwise become suicidal.

Physics: The physics for this simulator is intentionally discrete. This means
the frame is essentially the base unit of time, so each cell teleports to
the next location each frame. The main rules include:
    a) Repulsive Force: Cells push each other away if they are touching each
        other. This is called force and it is calculated based on the distance
        between the cells' centers of mass. The diameter of each cell
        determines when they touch and the extra amount of distance closer
        together increases the repulsive force dramatically.

        Contrary to Earthly physics, force does NOT care about the cells'
        masses. They will both be moved the same distance.
        
        However, if 2 cells' centers of mass occupy the same point,
        their repulsive force is at the maximum and the force is applied
        to each cell in a random direction (NOT necessarily in
        opposite directions).

        The repulsive forces can be amplified or lightened by a 
        customizeable force damping factor.
    b) Stickiness: TODO (not yet implemented as of 2023-05-24!!!)
    c) Wrapping along the x and y axes: If a cell exits one side of the screen,
        it enters the opposite side of the screen going in the same direction
        as before.
        As of 2023-05-24, a cell which exists on both sides of the screen
        is only rendered on the side that their center of mass is located,
        but regardless, x and y wrapping allows cells on the opposite side
        of the screen to exert forces on each other.


Decisions: Each cell must make various decisions each frame and then
execute them. It makes these decisions using its brain, which is a 
neural network that mutates its weights and biases genetically.
These decisions are made based on the neural network inputs and the
decisions themselves are the outputs of the neural network.
The inputs include:
    a) Internal timers (ex. age, attack cooldown)
    b) Controllable stats (ex. speed, direction, cloning direction)
    c) Its own genome (ex. vision, size, ...)
    d) Status or state (ex. health, energy, and forces)
    e) Its id
The outputs (decisions) include:
    a) Speed (idle, walking, or running) and Direction
    b) Cloning and Cloning Direction (if successful)
    c) Attacking (if successful)
    d) Self-destruct (the threshold is set higher so the initial cells
        don't use this feature as often)

Self-Destruct: Cells can kill themselves, preserving their energy as they
die. This may be useful for giving their allies energy.

Cloning: When a cell wants to clone itself AND it has enough energy to do so,
then the cell clones itself and expends significant resources in the process.
Cloning is instantaneous and the new cell starts off with a relatively
small amount of energy. The better the stats of the parent cell, the more
energy the parent must spend to clone themselves.
Cloned cells have a chance to mutate each stat based on the mutation constant
stored in their parent's genome.
Noteably, if mutations happen to create a high-cost build compared to the
parent, the parent does NOT have to spend extra energy while cloning itself.
